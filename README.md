A Clojure library which gives you high-scoring words for the iOS game
W.E.L.D.E.R.

## Usage

Start it up in the REPL. If you have "a," "b," and "c" as your gold tiles,
`(def gold-tiles ["a" "b" "c"])`. You get the idea. Get your best options by
doing something like `(take 20 lengthwise)`.

Best strategy I've found for W.E.L.D.E.R. is to make mega-high-scoring words
with as many gold/diamond/etc tiles as possible, so this gives you the longest
possible words you can create for any given assortment of gold tiles.
